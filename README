SpeedBlocks

You need SFML, TGUI and boost to run this, libraries can be found here:

	http://www.sfml-dev.org/
I am using version 2.4.2

	https://tgui.eu/
The game runs fine with the stable 0.7.3 except for a minor bug with when window
is rezised to a none-standard ratio. If you want it to remove this bug you need the
latest master from TGUIs github repo

	http://www.boost.org/
You only need boost/random from the boost libs. (Except MingW users, see below)

The ResourcePath.mm/hpp is only for Mac builds to be able to access the game resources.
Window/Linux uses EmptyResourcePath.h/cpp to replace it with a NULL fuction to make
source able to compile as-is on any OS.

MingwConverter.h is to address a bug in MingW32, witch doesn't give it access to
standard functions to_string() and stoi(). It's replaced with boost/lexical_cast so
if you want to compile with MingW32 you need that too.
This is again included in the source to make it compile as-is.

Please see the Wiki for additional instructions.

If you want to contribute, please make a fork where you can push until your code
is stable. I will integrate from there.
